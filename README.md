# hello-world

Hello all who read this!

My name is Steven Tanner, and I am currently an undergraduate at Western Washington University majoring in computer science. I have been coding for ~4.5 years, but I have rarely used github, so I am planning on uploading a few of my recent projects here soon. 

My coding background started off with a few years of c#/java in highschool, but quickly evolved once I started college. I have since learned HTML/CSS/Javascript for web design, as well as python and matlab for data science/machine learning. And not that it deserves mention, but I have also dabbled in various other languages for bits and peices of projects or just out of curiosity.

As far as my personal background, I grew up and currently live in Washington State, I play (or at least played for a long time in the past) a variety of sports including waterpolo, soccer, and basketball. I was also a very active member of the Boy Scouts in the past, acheiving Eagle rank and brotherhood honor in the Order of the Arrow.
